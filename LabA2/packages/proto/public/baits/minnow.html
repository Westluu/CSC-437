  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Minnow is the common name for a number of species of small freshwater fish,
    belonging to several genera of the family Cyprinidae and in particular the
    subfamily Leuciscinae. They are also known in Ireland as pinkeens.[1] While
    the common name can refer to a range of taxa, smaller fish in the subfamily
    Leusciscinae are considered by anglers to be "true" minnows.[2]

  <h2>As Food</h2>
  <p>
    While primarily used for bait, minnows can also be eaten directly by humans.
    Some Native American cultures have used minnows as food.[8] If minnows are
    small enough, they can be eaten whole.[9]
