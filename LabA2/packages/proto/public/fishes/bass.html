  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Bass is the name of some species (types) of fish that are often caught for
    food or sport. There are freshwater bass (that live in rivers and lakes) and
    saltwater bass (that live in the ocean). Many bass live in or near North
    America. Bass are from the order of Perciformes or "perch-like fish". Their
    name comes from the word for 'perch'

  <h2>As Food</h2>
  <p>
    While primarily used for bait, minnows can also be eaten directly by humans.
    Some Native American cultures have used minnows as food.[8] If minnows are
    small enough, they can be eaten whole.[9]
